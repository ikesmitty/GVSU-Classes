# A simple (and incomplete) demonstration of one you might test basic
# I-type and R-type instructions.
#
# When constructing a complete test suite, be sure to
# 
# (1) Test all operations
# (2) Test operations with several different inputs. 
# (3) Choose inputs carefully.  For example, suppose you switched
#     control wires so that addi instructions actually executed as ori
#     instructions.  The line addi "$3, $3, 0", will work correctly in
#     spite of the mistake.
